# Big Data: An Application of the Most Common Supervised ML Classifiers in Apache Spark using Sparklyr

<br>

This project is about an application of the most common supervised ML classifiers in Apache Spark using Sparklyr. The main results obtained are presented here, providing a clear guideline that identifies the classic steps in the modeling process, possible to adapt to any other equivalent database. The key sparklyr functions used are identified, allowing the reader to consult the appropriate bibliography and tutorial examples clearly and directly.
