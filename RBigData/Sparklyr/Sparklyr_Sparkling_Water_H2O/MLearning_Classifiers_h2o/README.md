# Big Data: MLearning Classifiers with Spark, Sparklyr, and H2O-Sparkling Water

<br>

This project is about an application of some common supervised ML classifiers in Apache Spark using Sparklyr and H2O-Sparkling Water. The main results obtained are presented here, providing a clear guideline that identifies the classic steps in the modeling process, possible to adapt to any other equivalent database. The key sparklyr and H2O-Sparkling Water functions used are identified, allowing the reader to consult the appropriate bibliography and tutorial examples clearly and directly.
